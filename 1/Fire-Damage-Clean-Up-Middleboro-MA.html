If there is a lot of mold development, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
