<h3>Fire Restoration in Independence - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the service on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water quickly. This could exacerbate the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves damp environments.<p>
