<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is important to identify if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and latent energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
