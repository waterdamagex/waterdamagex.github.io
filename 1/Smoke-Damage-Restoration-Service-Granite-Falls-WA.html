<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas when mixed with ammonia. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave poisonous residue. For these factors try to prevent using bleach and if you must use it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>

<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for an amount of time, become permanently damaged (i.e. they will never ever be the same). Other products may simply need to be decontaminated and transferred to high ground. Soft items like clothes, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Classifications of Water), which will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what need to be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, reserving items that we feel can not be successfully restored so you can make a list to turn into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then identify a compensation for your products according to the terms of your policy.</p>
