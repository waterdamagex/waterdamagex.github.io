<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Parsippany - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repair work, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
