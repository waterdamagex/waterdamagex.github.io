Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling suburban homes, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics constructed with materials other than stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies.
