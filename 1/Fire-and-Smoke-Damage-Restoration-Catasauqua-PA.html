<p>Recent Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
