<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. We know exactly what you are experiencing as we also have actually overcome water damage from a flooded basement in our home. Our experience has altered our lives forever. Our homes are our safe place. Home is where we raise our households, get together for vacations, and where we loosen up, relax, and locked out the busyness of everyday life.

<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
