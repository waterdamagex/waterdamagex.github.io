<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Rhinebeck</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
