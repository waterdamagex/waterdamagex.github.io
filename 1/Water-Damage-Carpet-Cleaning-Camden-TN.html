The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is essential to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and practical energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they react to each one and offer the very best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
