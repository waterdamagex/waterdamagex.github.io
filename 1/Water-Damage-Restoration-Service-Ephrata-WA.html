<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, however what brought the mold in the first place? The short response: darkness and the presence of wetness in the environment.

When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
