If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and should be eliminated.

This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
