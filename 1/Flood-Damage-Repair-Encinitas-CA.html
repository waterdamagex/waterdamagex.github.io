Examples of Category 3 water can consist of, but are not restricted to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap regardless of visible content or color; all types of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, hurricanes, or other weather related occasions.
