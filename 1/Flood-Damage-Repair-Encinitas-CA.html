Examples of Category 3 water can consist of, but are not restricted to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap regardless of visible content or color; all types of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, hurricanes, or other weather related occasions.

In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag prior to drying out, fixing it might simply require pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
