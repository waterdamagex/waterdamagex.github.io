<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.</p>
