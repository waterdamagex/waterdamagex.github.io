This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
