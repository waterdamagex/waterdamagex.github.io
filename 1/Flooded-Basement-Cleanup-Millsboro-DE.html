<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also often referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that establishes on damp products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside, mold development must be avoided. Mold reproduce by ways of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas.

<h3>Water Damage Repairs in Millsboro Delaware</h2>

Some products will take on more water than others, and some materials can be more challenging to dry.
