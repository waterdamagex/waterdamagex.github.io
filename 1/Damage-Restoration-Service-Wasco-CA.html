<p>Smoke damage is a common adverse effects of fire damage, however it can take place on its own if a fire is contained. If it is the result of water damage associated to a typical danger, when home insurance coverage covers mold. If scenarios such as burst pipes or an AC system overflow enable mold to grow, your homeowner's insurance will cover all or a few of the mold removal expense since the mold is considered an extension of water damage." Many property owner's insurance plan cover $5,000 of mold remediation, though some range from $1,000 to $10,000. It's also possible to purchase a floater or recommendation that includes additional mold protection to your home insurance policy.</p>

You can clean them off then you may seal the wood surfaces with a wood primer. This will restore the wood or the surface area to a better condition.
