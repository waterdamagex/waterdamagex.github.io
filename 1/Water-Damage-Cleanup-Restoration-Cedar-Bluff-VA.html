<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can buy devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air flow near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of wetness in the home are all really essential in managing high humidity that frequently causes mold development in our environment.</p>

<p>Class 2 - substantial amount of evaporation, water, and absorption load. Water invasion where wet, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually soaked up minimal wetness.</p>
<p>As far as insurance protection is concerned, damage brought on by surface area water intrusion to the residence is considered flood damage and is generally left out from protection under traditional property owners' insurance coverage. Surface water is water that goes into the dwelling from the surface area of the ground because of inundation or insufficient drain and triggers loss to the dwelling. Protection for surface water intrusion to the house would generally need a different flood insurance coverage.</p>
