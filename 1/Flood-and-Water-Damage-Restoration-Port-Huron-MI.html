<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Get rid of all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to remove it. They might be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion if drywall panels just reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised. When eliminating around the damaged area, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
<p>Likewise, given that bleach is primarily water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily soaked up by the product. So, while you might have rubbed out or stained the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually provided lots of water to regrow and possibly spread the mold below the surface. If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable versions of these and other guidance files are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be needed.<p>
