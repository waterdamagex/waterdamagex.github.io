The kind of wood floor covering you may have restricts the type and determines of repairs that need to occur. Solid hardwood floor covering permits a broader series of options to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for individual slabs.
