<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were really valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache since the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and just begins to sag before drying out, repairing it might simply need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
