Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
