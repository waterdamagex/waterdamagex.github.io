<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surfaces starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any hard surface areas to get rid of the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are gotten rid of, typically including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>

<p>Attics that aren't well aerated will frequently trap warm, wet air in the cold weather. This can lead 2 to mold affecting the rafters and wall studs.
