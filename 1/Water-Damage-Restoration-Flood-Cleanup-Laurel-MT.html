<p>Even when you include a little indoor fire, smoke damage can occur. That's because fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and the majority of people know how to include a fire.

Likewise, because it's in the air, it's almost difficult to contain. Even after a fire is dispatched, smoke in the air can trigger damage.
