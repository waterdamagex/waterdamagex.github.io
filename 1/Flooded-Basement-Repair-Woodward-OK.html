<p>Class 3 - biggest amount of water, absorption, and evaporation. Water intrusion where damp, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in minimal wetness.</p>
<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
