<p>Utilizing bleach or other chemicals to eliminate indoor mold growth is not required most of the times. The objective needs to be to eliminate mold development by cleaning or removing musty materials. If you are exposed, dead mold can still pose health dangers. Using bleach or other disinfectants on surface areas after mold removal may be needed where people are believed to be susceptible to fungal infections (such as an individual with body immune system issues).

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most noticeable, and damaging, item of this chemical reaction.
