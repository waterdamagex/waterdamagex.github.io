<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope problems, and building problems are an extremely serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing numerous problems due to dripping windows and doors, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, houses, condominiums, townhomes, hotels, industrial buildings are especially vulnerable to these problems as normally the builder subcontracts the exterior envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason resulting in corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Always prepared for a challenge, Bales put together a drying strategy that completely dried everything in seven days with very little trouble to the personnel and children. Using advanced devices, Bales specialists put little holes into the cabinets and walls on both sides, then required air into and out of the trapped spaces. We dried the carpet and pad in location and used HEPA air scrubbers to keep the air clean throughout the procedure. Restoration was unnecessary because of our drying strategies and equipment.</p>
