Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
