<h2>Water Damage From Broken Pipes Increased During Winter in Merrill</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater is imminent unless fixed quickly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
