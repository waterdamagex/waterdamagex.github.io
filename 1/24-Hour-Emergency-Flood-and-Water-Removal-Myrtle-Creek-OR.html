<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
