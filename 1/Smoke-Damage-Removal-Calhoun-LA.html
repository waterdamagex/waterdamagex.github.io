Underneath seemingly unblemished outsides made of different products-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged everything from window sills to insulation that as soon as puffed like pink fairy floss. In some cases, wood sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes easily, crumbling into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have infested some walls.</p>
<p>Recent Review: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing major water accumulation. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a number of hours and continued to drain the location prior to any damage was done to my home.
