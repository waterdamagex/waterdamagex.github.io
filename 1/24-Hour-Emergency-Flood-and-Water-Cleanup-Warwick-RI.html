<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also produces extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas when mixed with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave behind poisonous residue. For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you should utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
