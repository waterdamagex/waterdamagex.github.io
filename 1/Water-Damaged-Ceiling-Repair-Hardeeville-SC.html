Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you might notice small indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand gradually.</p>

Without a clear contract in writing the conclusions, information, measurements are delegated the interpretation of each party.</p>
