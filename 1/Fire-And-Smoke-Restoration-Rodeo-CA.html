Without proper cleaning, smoke odor remains in clothing, linens, drapes, pillows, clothing and other soft" items for months or longer.

Internal Revenue Service Restoration experts recuperate soft products utilizing the Esporta ES-3300 Wash System Its patented, environmentally-friendly washing system securely and completely deep cleans, deodorizes and sterilizes soft contents to return them to pre-fire condition.</p>
