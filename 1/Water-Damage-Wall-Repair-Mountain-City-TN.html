<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>

For these reasons attempt to avoid utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
