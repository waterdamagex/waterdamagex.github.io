<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for noticeable mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find signs of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first look for any safety threats, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted space entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely dispose of it. If they have been damaged, we will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them.</p>
