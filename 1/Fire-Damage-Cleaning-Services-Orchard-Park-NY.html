<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>If the weather allows, open doors and windows to eliminate wetness and odors. If the outside humidity ends up being higher than inside, close things up; likewise, close up your house over night if temperature levels drop and damp air might otherwise be drawn inside your home. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and remove whole sash. If doors are stuck, drive out door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then remove.</p>
<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments.</p>
