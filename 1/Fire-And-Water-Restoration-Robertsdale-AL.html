<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become contaminated with molds.
