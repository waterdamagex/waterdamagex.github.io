Disruptive techniques are used when contamination, customer, expense, or damage issues require removal or adjustment of the affected material. Water damage restoration and cleanup is what our team is here for. If you want to utilize vinegar to avoid mold growing on surfaces just spray vinegar on the surface area and leave it.  Repeat this every few days to make sure the surface will remain mold-free. You can even mop your tiled restroom floor or other tough non-porous floorings with vinegar if you are stressed over mold growing on them.<p>
