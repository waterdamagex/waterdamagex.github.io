<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Malverne</h3>
<p>Before you clean your house, you need to use proper security. Smoke, particles and soot can be dangerous to breathe in, so wear a respirator if there is significant soot in the damaged area. Use long trousers and sleeves to secure your skin. You should also wear gloves and eye protection. Because you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is necessary to set floor security and remove any furniture or household things that are not damaged. If the damaged area is little, you can probably get away with merely covering furniture with plastic or sheets. However if you're cleaning an entire space, it's a good idea to get rid of those clean items and even seal other spaces that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>
