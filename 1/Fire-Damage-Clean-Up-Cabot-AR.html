<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
