To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water easily. This might exacerbate the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves damp environments.<p>
