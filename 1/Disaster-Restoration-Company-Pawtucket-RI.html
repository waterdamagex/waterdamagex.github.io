The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.
