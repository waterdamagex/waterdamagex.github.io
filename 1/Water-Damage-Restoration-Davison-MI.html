<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
