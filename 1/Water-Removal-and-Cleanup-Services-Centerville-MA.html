<p>Mold is practically all over, drifting in the air and on all surface areas. Individuals are exposed to molds 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Direct exposures increase when indoor musty materials ends up being dried, damaged or interrupted, causing spores and other mold cells to be launched into the air and then breathed in. Raised direct exposure can also occur if individuals straight handle musty materials or inadvertently eat mold.</p>
