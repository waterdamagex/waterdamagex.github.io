<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to develop quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and contractor oversight.

<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health risks would not be minimized until mold pollutants are removed through cleaning. Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise making use of ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Pelham</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
