Call a water damage restoration company that can fully evaluate the extent of the damage, and can use the best course of action. Don't even consider taking a hair clothes dryer to your handset. Included heat could trigger rust if there is any water on your phone's hardware. Instead, begin with a soft, microfiber cloth, the kind you use to clean smudges off of your glasses. Use a cloth to wipe down the components inside if you can remove the back panel of your phone.<p>
<p>Don't touch or try to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, draperies or other household fabric products. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning harder. Utilize a dry, absorbent fabric to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Ensure to get the wetness out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
