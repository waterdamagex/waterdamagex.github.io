<p>When standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
