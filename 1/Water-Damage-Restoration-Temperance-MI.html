<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Temperance</h3>
<p>It is easy for a homeowner to think the damage to their home or company is restricted to the aesthetically verified damage. At FP Property Restoration, we know that this is not the case. Surrounding locations, contents, ventilation systems, and surface areas are all affected by smoke, water from the extinguishment of the fire, and the recurring odor that, if not dealt with correctly, will never leave your home.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can remove water vapor from the air in an included area, like a bed room or downstairs rec space. Shut the room's doors and windows to prevent more humidity from leaking in. Buy a huge dehumidifier ($ 270) so you do not have to empty its water drawer often. First things first. Get the iPhone out of the water immediately, if you have not already. And do not even think of plugging it in.<p>
