The CDC advises that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and glasses, waterproof boots, and a mask ranked a minimum of N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth. Keep in mind that while these masks safeguard you from little particles like mold, they are not adequate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
