<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Even as contractors have actually combated claims, almost 2 dozen property owners said that they were never alerted of any potential issue-- even as some building executives knew of its extent. Toll's vice president of building, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, affirmed in 2017 that, within slightly more than two years, he had examined 300 to 350 houses in the region for water invasion-- with approximately 85 percent requiring repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court. Many homeowners have discovered the issues just after it's too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the due date by simply weeks or months.</p>
