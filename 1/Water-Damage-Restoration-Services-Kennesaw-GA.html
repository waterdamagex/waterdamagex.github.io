<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Kennesaw</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
