Conventional refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier loses efficiency as the air dries below 55 grains per pound.

<p>Don't try or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furnishings, drapes or other home fabric items. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the material, making cleaning more difficult.

Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
