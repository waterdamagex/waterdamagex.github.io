<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall products normally don't dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's generally best to rip them out to prevent mold, specifically if they aren't completely dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will eliminate mold on difficult non-porous surface areas such as counter tops, glass or tiles but it is inadequate at killing mold growing in permeable material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>For this reason, we developed a four-step method that permits us to clean the affected location without compromising the rest of your home. We can help restore the environment in your house and supply long-term treatments that keep mold development at bay.
