<p>Because typical building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
