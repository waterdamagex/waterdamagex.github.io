<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
