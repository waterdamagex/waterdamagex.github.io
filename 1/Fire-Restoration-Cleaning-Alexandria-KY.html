<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going person.</p>
