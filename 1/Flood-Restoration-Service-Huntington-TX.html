<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Computing the humidity is important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid type if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
