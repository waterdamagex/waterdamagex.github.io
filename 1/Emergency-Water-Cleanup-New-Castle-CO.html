<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges.
