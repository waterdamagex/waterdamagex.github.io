<h3>Water Damage Equipment in Auburndale Florida</h2>
<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are terrific for drying in hard to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout wet surfaces, vaporizing moisture into the air. With making use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when wet incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This process takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
