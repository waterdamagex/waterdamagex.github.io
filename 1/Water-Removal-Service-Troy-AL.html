<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health hazard and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.
