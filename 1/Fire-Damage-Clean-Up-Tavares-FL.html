<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
