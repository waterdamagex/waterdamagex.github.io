<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected stretching rural houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with materials aside from stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
