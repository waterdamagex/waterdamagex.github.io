An unique HEPA vacuum ensures that even tiny particles get collected to minimize the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold.

Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, specifically for the very first 36 to two days of drying and is the optimum temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers.
