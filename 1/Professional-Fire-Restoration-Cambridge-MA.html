<h3>Flood Restoration Equipment in Cambridge Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Water cleanup can refer to any type of tidy up after water gets in, but it is especially important following flooding and flood damage.

<p>These actions must be detailed by a professional, certified as a mold assessor or in mold removal, and are based on the ANSI IICRC S500 Specialist Requirement for Water Damage and the ANSI IICRC S520 Expert Standard for Mold Remediation. ANSI (American National Standards Institute) recommendations are based upon strong, well-documented science and represent the closest thing to a federal requirement around.</p>
