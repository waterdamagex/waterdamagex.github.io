<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or methods will be the most reliable. It is important to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the much faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
