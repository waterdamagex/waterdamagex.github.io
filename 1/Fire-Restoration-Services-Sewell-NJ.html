This depends upon how it was damaged. If it was fully submerged in a liquid, the response is more than likely no, due to the fact that liquids can corrode the inner operations of the phone.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
