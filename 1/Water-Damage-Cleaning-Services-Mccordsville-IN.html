<p>Mold damage may or may not be covered by your property owner's insurance. It might be covered by insurance when a product already covered under your house owners insurance breaks unintentionally-- for instance, if your plumbing suddenly ruptures and water floods your home, the property owners insurance coverage will cover part or all of the expenses for the pipes repair and any mold remediation expenses required as a direct outcome of the water damage.<p>
