<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you might notice little indications like coffee-colored discolorations that may expand with time.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that includes a substantial quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying may require unique methods, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>When disaster strikes, hold-up in response time can cost countless dollars in loss of inventory, home and additional living expenditures. Water damaged items become non-salvageable without competent and fast restoration services, costing thousands of dollars, as a result. Elite Restoration can cut your replacement costs by as much as 70%. We achieve your cost savings by utilizing appropriate drying techniques that restore soaked structural products to their initial condition. Elite Restoration also works to avoid future wetness issues and secure the untouched locations from humidity damage.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes.</p>
