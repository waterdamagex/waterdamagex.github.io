However you can control mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>
<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too.
