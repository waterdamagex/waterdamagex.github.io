<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>
