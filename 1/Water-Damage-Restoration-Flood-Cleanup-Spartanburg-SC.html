<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Spartanburg</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>
