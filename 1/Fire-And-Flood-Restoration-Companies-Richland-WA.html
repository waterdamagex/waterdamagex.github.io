LGR dehumidifiers continue to eliminate a substantial amount of water vapor below 40 grains per pound.

<p>Evaluation reports and lawsuits by seven next-door neighbors on the block now allege that building problems enabled water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had actually most likely disintegrated and established mold.

<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Richland</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health danger and must be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
