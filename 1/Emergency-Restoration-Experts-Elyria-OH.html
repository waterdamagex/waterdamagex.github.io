<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Elyria</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
