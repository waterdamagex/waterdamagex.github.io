<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most devastating things that can take place to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being totally replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor may need replacing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The type of wood flooring you might have limits the type and figures out of repair work that need to happen. Strong hardwood flooring enables a larger series of alternatives to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for private planks.
