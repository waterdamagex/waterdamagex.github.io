<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
