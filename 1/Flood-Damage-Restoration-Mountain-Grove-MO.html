<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials typically do not dry extremely well, so if your walls are soaked, it's normally best to rip them out to avoid mold, especially if they aren't completely dry within two days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on hard non-porous surfaces such as countertops, glass or tiles but it is inefficient at killing mold growing in porous product such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>An option of cleaning agent and warm water can be utilized to scrub surface area mold off non-porous surface areas. Although detergent itself doesn't eliminate mold, if the mold is on non-porous products then the option doesn't need to kill it as long as you totally clean away all the mold on the surface. Using a pump sprayer, mist the surface areas with water to manage the spread of spores, and roll up the sections. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
