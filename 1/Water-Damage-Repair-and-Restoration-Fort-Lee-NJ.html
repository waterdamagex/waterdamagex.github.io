<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
