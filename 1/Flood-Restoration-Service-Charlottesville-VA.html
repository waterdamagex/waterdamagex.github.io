<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally damaging. As soon as InstaScope was created, we engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological elements of air pollution, this group was designated to confirm and check the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other technique or device, can deliver scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical offender of damage in many of our houses and organisations here in Central Illinois. When moisture is present, mold spores can spread out rapidly.
