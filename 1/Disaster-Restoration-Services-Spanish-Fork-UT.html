<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely devastating. When InstaScope was created, we engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged professional on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was appointed to verify and check the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
