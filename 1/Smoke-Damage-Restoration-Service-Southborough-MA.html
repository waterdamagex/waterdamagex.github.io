<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job appropriately.
