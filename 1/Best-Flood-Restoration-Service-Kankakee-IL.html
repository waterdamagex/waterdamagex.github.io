<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
