Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous person.</p>
