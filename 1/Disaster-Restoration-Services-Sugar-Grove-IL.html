<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Sugar Grove</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
