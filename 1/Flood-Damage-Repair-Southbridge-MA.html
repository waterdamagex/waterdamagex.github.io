<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>
