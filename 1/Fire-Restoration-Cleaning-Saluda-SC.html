Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
