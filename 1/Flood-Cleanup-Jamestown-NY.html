<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Sometimes water flows unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall. Unless water discolorations appear, this moisture could go undetected until molds and smell issues happen.

Today's restoration is more than drying wet carpets.</p>
