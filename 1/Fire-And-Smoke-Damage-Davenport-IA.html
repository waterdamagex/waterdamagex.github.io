Ultimately, the mold will damage the materials it is growing on and might trigger health results for occupants.<p>

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to cause health effects. Mold can activate allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold needs water to grow it is essential to avoid moisture and humidity issues in buildings, specifically ones impacted by water.<p>
