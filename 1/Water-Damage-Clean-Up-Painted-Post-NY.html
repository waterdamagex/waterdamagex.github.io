<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself.
