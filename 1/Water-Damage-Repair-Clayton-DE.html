Your insurance company may be hesitant to concur that any potential mold is the outcome of previous water damage, however having records and images will serve as important evidence of your claim.

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout numerous days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
