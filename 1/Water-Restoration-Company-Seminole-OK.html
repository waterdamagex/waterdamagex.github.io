<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you truly want to avoid acquiring a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and clean it directly over mold growth. Let the solution sit for up to 10 minutes, and then scrub the area with a small brush or toothbrush. Clean any remaining mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>
