<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
