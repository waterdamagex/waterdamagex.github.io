<p>Make sure the specialist has experience cleaning up mold if you select to employ a professional (or other professional service supplier) to do the cleanup. Examine referrals and ask the contractor to follow the suggestions in EPA guide Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists (ACGIH), or other standards from professional or federal government companies.</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health risk, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Mold is a major-league annoyance. It blackens the grout lines in your shower, stains drywall, appears as black spots on siding, darkens decks, and grows on and decays moist wood everywhere.
