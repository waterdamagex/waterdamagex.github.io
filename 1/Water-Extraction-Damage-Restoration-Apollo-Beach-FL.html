<p>Regrettably, however, using bleach is only effective if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bath tubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not permeate into porous products and so it does not enter contact with mold growing beneath the surface of products such as wood and drywall. Utilizing bleach on these materials will kill the mold above the surface area but the roots within the product will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>Food sources for mold in buildings consist of cellulose-based products such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and organic matter such as soap, fabrics, and dust consisting of skin cells. If a home has mold, the moisture may come from the basement or crawl area, a dripping roofing or a leak in plumbing pipelines. Insufficient ventilation might accelerate moisture buildup. Visible mold nests might form where ventilation is poorest and on border walls (because they are nearest the humidity ).</p>
