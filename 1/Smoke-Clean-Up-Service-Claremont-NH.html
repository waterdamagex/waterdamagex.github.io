Look for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).

Basic household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a room adequately.</p>
