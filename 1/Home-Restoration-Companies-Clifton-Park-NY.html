When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
