<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
