<p>First things first - prepare what you require Generally, you need a reliable item in cleaning mold. Lots of home owners believe that bleach is a reliable mold treatment. But contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can harm your health. Likewise, it does not eliminate the mold. It just alters its color from black to white or grey.

<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Sound Beach</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section.

Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water easily. This might exacerbate the problem because as you know - mold loves damp environments.<p>
