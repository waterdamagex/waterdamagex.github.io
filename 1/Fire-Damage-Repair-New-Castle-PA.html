If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipelines, duct and wiring.</p>
