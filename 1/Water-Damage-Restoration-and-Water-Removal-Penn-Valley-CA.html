<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth finding out. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
