There is no trusted timetable for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal components generally begin rusting right away after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the corrosion procedure takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.
