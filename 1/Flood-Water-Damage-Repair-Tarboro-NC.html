<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also offers off extreme fumes and it even produces harmful gas. There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce hazardous fumes or leave hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you need to use it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
