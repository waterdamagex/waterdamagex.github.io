<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
