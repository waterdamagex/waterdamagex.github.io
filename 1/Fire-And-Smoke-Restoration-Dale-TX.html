A number of hundred suits filed in the last 5 years declare that the majority of these homes contain dozens of violations of the state-mandated building regulations that eventually allowed water to drain pipes into both brand-new and refurbished homes. Many homes with water damage lack standard weatherproofing products, inspection reports say. Coats of stucco are frequently too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so bad that, even before the family moved in, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bed room.</p>
<p>Prior to the house has actually dried, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, a lot of water, a detergent and disinfectant.
