<p>While the iPhone 7 and later are water-resistant, it doesn't stop water from entering the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later have a similar issue, although they come with an integrated function that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to cause health impacts. Mold can activate allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some individuals are allergic to mold.
