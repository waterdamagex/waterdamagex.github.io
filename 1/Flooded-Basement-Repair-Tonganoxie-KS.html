<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
