<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

Fires and smoke release toxins that not just leave harsh odors but are also hazardous to you and your enjoyed ones' health.

<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going person.</p>
