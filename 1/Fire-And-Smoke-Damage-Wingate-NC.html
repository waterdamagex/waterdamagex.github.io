<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying since the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going person.<p>
<p>Deodorization: In regards to deodorization, we use either ozone makers, which can just be used when the home is entirely uninhabited for an extended time, or hydroxyl units.

Often, the unit will be set closest to the cause of the fire to be most reliable.<p>
