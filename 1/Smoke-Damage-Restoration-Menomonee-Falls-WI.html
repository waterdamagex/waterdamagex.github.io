<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Menomonee Falls</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
