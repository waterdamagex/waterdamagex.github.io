<h3>Home Restoration Companies in Medford New Jersey</h2>
<p>Make sure the contractor has experience cleaning up mold if you pick to work with a contractor (or other expert service company) to do the cleanup. Examine references and ask the specialist to follow the recommendations in EPA guide Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists (ACGIH), or other guidelines from professional or government organizations.</p>
<p>Make certain to keep images of the water damage and all files related to the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurance provider might be hesitant to agree that any prospective mold is the result of prior water damage, however having pictures and records will act as valuable evidence of your claim. If the mold is considered to have actually come from water damage, some insurance providers might make you submit a 2nd claim of water damage rather, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation happens.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a good alternative to chlorine bleach since it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave harmful residue or produce toxic fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
