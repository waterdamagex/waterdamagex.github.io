<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. We engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado when InstaScope was produced. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally acknowledged expert on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was appointed to confirm and test the brand-new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a new mold-assessment system for industrial clients that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver clinically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you consider all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was a best storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to construct faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
