<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>

Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop prior to drying out, fixing it may just require pushing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
