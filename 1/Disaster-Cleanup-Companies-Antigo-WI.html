<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite individual.</p>
