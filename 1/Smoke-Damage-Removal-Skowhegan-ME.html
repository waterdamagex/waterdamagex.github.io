<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
