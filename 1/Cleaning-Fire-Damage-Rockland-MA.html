They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
