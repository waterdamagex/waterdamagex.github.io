Toll's vice president of building, Anthony Geonnotti, for instance, testified in 2017 that, within somewhat more than 2 years, he had actually checked 300 to 350 homes in the area for water intrusion-- with roughly 85 percent requiring repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court. Numerous house owners have discovered the issues only after it's far too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the due date by just months or weeks.</p>
