Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
