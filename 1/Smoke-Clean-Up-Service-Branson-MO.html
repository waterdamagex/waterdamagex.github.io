<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals think that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.
