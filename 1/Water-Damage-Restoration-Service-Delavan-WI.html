Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes.</p>

Getting an area dry needs eliminating the moisture not only from the afflicted materials but likewise from the air. Fans will blow air across the surface and trigger the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not kick back into the product and trigger additional damage to the space.<p>
