<h2>Risks When It Comes to Wilmette Water Damage in Crawlspaces</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Any building that has suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another possible effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the degree of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
