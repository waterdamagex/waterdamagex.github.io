These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
