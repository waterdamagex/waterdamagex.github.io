Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going individual.</p>
