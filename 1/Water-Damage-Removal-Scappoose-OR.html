<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most efficient. It is vital to figure out if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit.
