<p>Mold damage might or might not be covered by your house owner's insurance coverage. It might be covered by insurance coverage when a product already covered under your property owners insurance breaks mistakenly-- for instance, if your plumbing suddenly ruptures and water floods your home, the property owners insurance coverage will cover part or all of the costs for the pipes repair and any mold remediation expenses necessary as a direct result of the water damage.<p>
<p>Spread out rugs and carpets outdoors if salvage is attempted. Hose off. Expertly clean or work in carpet hair shampoo with a broom if stained. Rinse well with a solution of 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons liquid family chlorine bleach to sanitize (if colorfast). If carpet is wool, do not add bleach. Dropping a phone in water happens to the best of us. With that stated, some people just seem to have their you-know-what together and do not appear to have these accidents. A few easy suggestions can put you in their league and keep your phone dry.<p>
