<p>Step 1: An evaluation and damage control is always the initial step in the restoration process. A professional evaluations the area and makes an in-depth plan for how to make the location safe and structurally noise. Referral the remediation strategy during the real remediation to ensure it's being followed. The warranty supervisor should upgrade the plan if extra mold is discovered during the clean up.<p>
