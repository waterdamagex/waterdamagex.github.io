<p>If it has actually not spread far and wide, getting rid of mold from wood is easy. Before beginning, place on your protective wear, specifically a mask and gloves. Initially, vacuum up the area with the mold. This will suck up any loose spores on the surface area of the wood. Next, scrub the area with soap and water. On bare, unpainted or without treatment wood, you can use bleach. Take in any cleaner and extra moisture.<p>
<p>Likewise, given that bleach is mostly water, on porous surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily soaked up by the product. So, while you might have rubbed out or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact provided lots of water to regrow and possibly spread out the mold below the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other assistance files are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
