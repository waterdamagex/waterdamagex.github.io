What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
