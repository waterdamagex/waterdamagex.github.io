<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>

If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and should be removed.
