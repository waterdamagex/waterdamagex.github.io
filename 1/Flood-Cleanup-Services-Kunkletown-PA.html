The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread the soot and make it impossible to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas beneath. Or merely get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a wiping movement the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the stains.</p>
