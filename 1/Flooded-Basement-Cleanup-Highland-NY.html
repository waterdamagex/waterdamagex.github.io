<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a wet towel. Just like a few of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>

<h3>Commercial Water Damage Restoration in Highland New York</h2>
<p>If there are dark areas on your ceiling, walls or floorings, this is a sure sign of mold development. Musty smells and mildew are typically indications that mold may be growing in your house. Breathing and allergy symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, problem breathing and wheezing are a common indicator of mold development as well. Also, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surface areas are an indication of mold.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications.</p>
