<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
