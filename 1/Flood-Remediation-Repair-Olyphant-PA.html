An unique HEPA vacuum makes sure that even small particles get collected to reduce the opportunities of the mold moving elsewhere. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold.

Make sure that you get to the source of the molds and you need to open up the walls to find them. Scrub the surfaces with a mold cleaner and do this thoroughly. After scrubbing, leave the solution for a little while to enable it to penetrate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is embeding in, you might now tidy up the wall particles. Use a vacuum cleaner to get rid of the moldy wall.</p>
