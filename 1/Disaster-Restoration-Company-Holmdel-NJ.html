We are also part of a national network of over 1,700 Franchises with special Disaster Recovery Groups positioned strategically throughout the country to respond to large-scale fire, water, and storm catastrophes.

<p>The function of water mitigation is to avoid more damage in a water damage circumstance. Service contractors eliminate impacted structures, like drywall and floor covering. If left unaddressed, damp floor covering and drywall can rapidly cause major problems, like structural weakening and mold development. Ulocladium: this mold requires excessive quantities of water to grow, so it is generally just discovered in homes that have undergone flooding. Many people are allergic to this type of mold.<p>
<p>Aggressive or in location" drying techniques involve leaving damp items in the structure and drying them in place utilizing warm, dry, direct airflow. Aggressive approaches are utilized when contamination and damage are not concerns, and when it is cost-effective to dry a product rather of replacing it. We work and live in this community too; we may even be next-door neighbors. As a locally owned and operated service, SERVPRO of West Volusia is nearby and prepared to aid with your mold-damaged residential or commercial property.<p>
