You can even mop your tiled bathroom floor or other tough non-porous floors with vinegar if you are worried about mold growing on them.<p>

<p>Many extremely infectious diseases are connected to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's illness, as well as blood, liver, and kidney concerns. Some of the mold on the surface might be eliminated however the roots of the mold are left undamaged indicating the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated whitening.
