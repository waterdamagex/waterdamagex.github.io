<h2>The Types of Water Damage in Pittsfield</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
