<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
