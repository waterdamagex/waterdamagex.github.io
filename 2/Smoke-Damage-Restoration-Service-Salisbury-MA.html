<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.<p>
