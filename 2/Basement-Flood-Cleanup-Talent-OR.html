<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can occur on its own if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers absorb wetness through chemical destination rather of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that draws in and holds wetness. This product acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through warmed exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially look for any safety hazards, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely dispose of it. We will likewise examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
