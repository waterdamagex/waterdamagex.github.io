<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials generally do not dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's normally best to rip them out to avoid mold, particularly if they aren't absolutely dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will eliminate mold on hard non-porous surfaces such as countertops, glass or tiles but it is inadequate at eliminating mold growing in porous material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>If walls have currently dried, work from the floor to the ceiling to prevent streaking. (Dirty water splashed on dry walls might be soaked up and become almost difficult to remove.)

<p>Use a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it might unintentionally push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to draw more water out if the phone was entirely submerged. As soon as the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is crucial to avoid recontamination. You should seal and immediately get rid of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
