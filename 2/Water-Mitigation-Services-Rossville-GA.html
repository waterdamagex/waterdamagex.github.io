There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air.
