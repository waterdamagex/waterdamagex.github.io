<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise in some cases described as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on damp materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside, mold growth should be avoided. Mold recreate by methods of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature level, wetness, and readily available nutrient conditions are correct, the spores can form into brand-new mold nests where they are transferred. 1 There are many kinds of mold, but all need wetness and a food source for growth.</p>
