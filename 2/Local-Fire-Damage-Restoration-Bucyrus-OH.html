<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature always attempts to reach balance. Determining the humidity is necessary in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity always takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
