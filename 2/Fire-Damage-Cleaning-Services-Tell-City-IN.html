<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By minimizing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
