<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or business is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being totally changed. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require changing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The sort of wood floor covering you may have restricts the type and determines of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader series of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for individual planks. The best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
