<p>If smoke and fire damage has affected your belongings, we will work with you and your insurer to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the location solid again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Our innovative mold examinations, mold treatment analysis, mold removal equipment, mold testing packages, and high-tech electronic cameras, will find and stop mold dead in its tracks. We can determine the source of the water supplying the mold, then we isolate the location by using HEPA-filtration systems that produces negative air pressure chambers. Flooding and water emergency situations do not wait on routine business hours and neither do we. We supply emergency water restoration services 24 hr a day, 7 days a week - consisting of all holidays. Purdy citizens can anticipate an immediate response night, day or time.<p>
