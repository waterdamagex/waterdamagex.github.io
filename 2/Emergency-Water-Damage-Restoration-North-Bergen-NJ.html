<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and great, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Water damage develops from broken pipes, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water carries contaminants and need to be considered harmful.

If ignored, even clean water can create mildew and other bacterial development.</p>
