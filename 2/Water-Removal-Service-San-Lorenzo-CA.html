<h3>Cleaning Water Damage in San Lorenzo California</h2>
<p>Flooring water damage. Another indication to search for is the warping of flooring products due to water exposure. If the spot is situated in the corners of a space or versus a wall, flooring water damage can really go undetected for some time. If you notice any warping of wood or vinyl 6 flooring, then the area is likely exposed. Furthermore, wet areas of carpet suggest water damage.</p>
<p>During a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your home or office might seem the least of your issues.

<p>Some air cleaners are created to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at killing air-borne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health dangers would not be decreased until mold pollutants are eliminated through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise making use of ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
