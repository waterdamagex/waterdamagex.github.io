<p>Clean it: Mold is remediated using antimicrobial and biocide agents that are sprayed to suspend or eliminate any microbes. Permeable materials like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and material are usually eliminated.

Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading out.<p>
