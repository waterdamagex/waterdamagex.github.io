<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Platteville</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is ended up.<p>
