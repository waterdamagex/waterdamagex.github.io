<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
