<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Getting rid of one of the 3 requirements for mold reduces (or eliminates) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat since mold usually does not grow in cold environments. I had a fantastic experience dealing with the group at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, prompt and very communicative! I would absolutely suggest for any mitigation or restoration work you need.<p>

However, in some cases you will require an expert to repair the source and identify of unwanted water flow.
