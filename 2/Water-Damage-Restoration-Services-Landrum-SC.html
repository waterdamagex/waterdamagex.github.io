Black mold can be dangerous to your health, generally triggering breathing issues. However in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you might want to purchase a mold testing package to see what kind of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire a specialist to aid with removal.
