<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Mold is a common culprit of damage in a number of our businesses and homes here in Central Illinois. When wetness is present, mold spores can spread quickly. Frequently it can take hold in less than 48 hours after a wetness damage has actually taken place. The growth not just causes damages to surface areas and structures but has the possible to produce allergens and irritants that have the potential to cause other health effects. Please contact us at 217-528-7775 if you suspect that your home or company has a mold problem. Our crew has the accreditations, knowledge, and experience to remediate the damage.</p>

<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier gets rid of water vapor from the air using a process called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to eliminate a significant amount of water vapor below 40 grains per pound. Due to the fact that they are much more energy effective and they can pull the grains down much lower, lgrs are a special type of commercial and residential grade refrigerant dehumidifiers. LGR dehumidifiers utilize a double cooling or improved action to decrease the moisture-laden air temperature level when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
