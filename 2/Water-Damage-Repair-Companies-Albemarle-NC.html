<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
