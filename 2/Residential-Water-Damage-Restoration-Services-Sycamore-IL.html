<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Sycamore</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health risk and must be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
