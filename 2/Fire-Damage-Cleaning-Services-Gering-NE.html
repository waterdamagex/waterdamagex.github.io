Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
