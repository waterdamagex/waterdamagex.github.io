<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Chittenango</h3>
<p>Inspect the drywall to see how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to remove it. If drywall panels just show water spots but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by eliminating the damaged part. When cutting out around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not kill mold. Try to keep yourself, kids, workers and others out of the affected location. Trying to dry the area with a fan may disrupt the spores and spread them to a new area.
