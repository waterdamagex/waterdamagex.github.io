Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself.
