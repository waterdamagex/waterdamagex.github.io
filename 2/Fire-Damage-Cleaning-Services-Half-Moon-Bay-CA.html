<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to remove it. If drywall panels only show water discolorations but aren't structurally jeopardized, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
