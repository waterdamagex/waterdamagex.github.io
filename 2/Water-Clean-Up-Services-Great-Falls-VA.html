<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
