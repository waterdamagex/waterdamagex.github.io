<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was basic: It was a best storm"-- a mix that attorneys now declare came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and builder oversight.

<p>When you are preparing big repairs, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is ended up.<p>
