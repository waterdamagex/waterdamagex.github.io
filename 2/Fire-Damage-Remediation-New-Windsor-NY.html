<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you truly want to avoid buying a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can likewise soak a towel in this option and wipe it straight over mold development.
