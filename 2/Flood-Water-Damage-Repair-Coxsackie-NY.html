Our service technicians will then press clean all affected semi-porous and non-porous building products, such as cement, wood, and tile. Then, they will use bactericide in order to reduce the effects of germs and other contaminants. Lastly, service technicians will force-dry the location utilizing commercial structural drying devices.<p>
