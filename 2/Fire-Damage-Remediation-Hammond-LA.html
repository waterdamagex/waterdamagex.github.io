<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Hammond</h3>
<p>Water damage restoration is best identified within the Institute of Assessment, Cleaning and Restoration Accreditation (IICRC) Standard and Recommendation Guide or Expert Water Damage Restoration (IICRC S500 -2015 4th Edition). The document lays out the principles behind safe water restoration and consists of actions a vendor need to think about with reference material behind the requirements. It is important to note that while the IICRC S500 provides the foundation for standard concepts, it does not teach complex water damage processes.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not kill mold. Try to keep yourself, children, staff members and others out of the affected area. Attempting to dry the location with a fan may interrupt the spores and spread them to a new area. Eliminating black mold is a detailed procedure that requires persistence, an investment in protective gear and black mold removal items, and, naturally, the nerve to brave dark, confined spaces inhabited by poisonous fungus.<p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
