<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Severe flooding and water damage can frequently take place in the blink of an eye. Violent weather condition, major plumbing failures or roofing leakages can trigger an abrupt rise of water to flood into a home or workplace.

<p>As the task progresses and the environment is stabilized, products can be dried by handling the energy, humidity, and airflow (heat). Even more into the drying, air motion should be re-directed and guarantee excellent transfer of energy to the remaining damp areas. The total need for humidity control and air flow can be lower than at the start of the task considering that there is substantially less moisture in products being vaporized during the latter phase.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we wish to address the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at getting rid of mold than a moderate detergent and a damp fabric, so we suggest the least harmful alternative.</p>
<p>Class 1 - least quantity of water, evaporation, and absorption load. Water invasion where wet, permeable products (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent less than ~ 5% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where products referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have absorbed minimal moisture.</p>
