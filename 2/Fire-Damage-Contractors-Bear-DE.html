<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, but everything they did for me was excellent. When they were giving me issues, they best thing about First Action was that they were able to manage my insurance company. This probably assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the concern for me, which was a huge relief. They were very professional, and I liked everybody I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my fulfillment. I would utilize them once again.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, kids, employees and others out of the afflicted location.
