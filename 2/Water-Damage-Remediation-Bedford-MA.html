<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that includes a significant quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built up assemblies).
