Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they grow. If there is moisture dripping through it, the concrete foundation of your home can cause dripping in the basement. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roofing system, which can result in mold and decomposing. When checking your home for potential reasons for water damage make certain to look out for moisture in lights as well as the total condition of any noticeable piping.</p>
