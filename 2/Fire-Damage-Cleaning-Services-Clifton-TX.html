<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any difficult surface areas to eliminate the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are gotten rid of, generally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
