<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
