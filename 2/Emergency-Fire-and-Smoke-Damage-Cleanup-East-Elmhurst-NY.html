Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
