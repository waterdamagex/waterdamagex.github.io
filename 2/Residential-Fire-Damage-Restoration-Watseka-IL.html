<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of noticeable mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the musty areas, in addition to any nearby locations. Make sure it will not stain the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a neighboring exit as opposed to the primary house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
