<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish wear and tear of products (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electrical power, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently called rust). There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting instantly after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of a problem. How fast the deterioration process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid.
