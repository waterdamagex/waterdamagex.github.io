<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences.

Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is wet and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores.

<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungis that quickly reach critical mass wherever moisture is present indoors. This can result from any variety of scenarios such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipe, and even a malfunctioning HVAC system - all of which can lead to trouble. Any high degree of moisture, integrated with temperature level and nutrients, creates the ideal environment for the fungal components of mold and mildew to grow. It is essential to get rid of the source of the moisture to prevent the spread of mold contamination as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Most mold problems begin little, and might go unnoticed if they are inside a crawl space, duct, or other inconspicuous area. Therefore, your very first sign of a mold problem may be a musty odor. Other indications consist of staining on the ceilings or walls and visible mold development on walls and other surfaces. This may also be an indication of a mold problem if you have a boost in allergic reaction symptoms taking place indoors.</p>
