<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be unsafe to your health, mainly triggering breathing problems. But in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you think a mold intrusion, you may want to purchase a mold screening package to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and hire an expert to help with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help eliminate mold.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
