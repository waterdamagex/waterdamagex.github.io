<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be hazardous to your health, mainly causing respiratory problems. However in extreme cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you think a mold invasion, you might want to purchase a mold testing package to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and employ an expert to aid with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you most likely currently have on-hand) that will help remove mold.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any tough surfaces to get rid of the mold from the surface area. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are eliminated, generally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
