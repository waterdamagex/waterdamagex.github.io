<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected sprawling suburban houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences built with products besides stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local firms. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Our group will come out to your property to assess the fire and inspect and smoke damage that has actually taken place.

<h3>Flood Restoration in Rockland Massachusetts</h2>
<p>We recently had major water damage due to a cleaning machine overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action essential to avoid more damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They also finished the entire dry which took numerous days and a lot of hard work. Always shown up on time and did what they guaranteed and kept me informed of each action. It was a pleasure to deal with the whole group. I would not be reluctant to suggest them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach equilibrium. Determining the humidity is very important in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the humidity rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>A great way to prevent mold from growing in your home is to minimize humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, examine your home for leakages. Mop it up quickly and dry the area if water does enter your home. Also, attempt to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, naturally) or putting fans in your room. And keep your indoor humidity below 60%.</p>
