The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most effective. It is vital to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
