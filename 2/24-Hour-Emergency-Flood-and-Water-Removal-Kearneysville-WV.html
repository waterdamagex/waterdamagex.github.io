<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Kearneysville - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, bear in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
