<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Throughout a water loss emergency, almost every area of your Seattle home might be at risk for damage. Moving water and moisture can permeate permeable surfaces and contents, which can modify their appearance and trigger irreversible damage within the very first two days of direct exposure.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
