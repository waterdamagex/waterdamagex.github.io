The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
