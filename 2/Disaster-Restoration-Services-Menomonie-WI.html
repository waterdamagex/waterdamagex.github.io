<p>Removing one of the 3 requirements for mold lowers (or gets rid of) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat given that mold typically does not grow in cold environments. I had a great experience working with the team at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, really communicative and punctual! I would absolutely recommend for any mitigation or restoration work you require.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (up to 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Position your patch into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the substance and enable it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint substance to complete the repair. As water and storm damage professionals, we have the experience and advanced training that allows us to restore your home quickly. We utilize clinical drying concepts and supply recognition and documentation that your home is dry and the task is complete.<p>
<p>Do not try or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other home textile products. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning harder. Use a dry, absorbent cloth to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess wetness off with an absorbent cloth. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
