<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might exacerbate the problem since as you understand - mold likes damp environments.<p>
