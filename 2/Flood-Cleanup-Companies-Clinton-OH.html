<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Over time, roofing systems might develop dark streaks. It may be dirt that can be simply power-washed off, or it may be mold. You shouldn't have anything growing, or perhaps creating a welcoming environment, for critters, bugs, or birds. If the plants and animals of your neighborhood decides to settle in on your roofing, it's going to start to wear and break down faster. If you notice your roofing system looking in need of some attention, talk with an expert contractor.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration includes changing products like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as basic as installing a couple of panels of drywall, while serious cases could require replacing whole walls. Exposure to harmful compounds like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older houses are likely to contain these substances.</p>

<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and typically have bad ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can trigger mold to thrive. And naturally, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather or undetected leaks in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>

For long-term issues, like mold triggered by attic condensation, the mold might have begun growing a long time ago. And if you discover mold and mildew issues, you need to be very cautious. Some mold is poisonous to humans, and all mold is really harmful to the materials it infests. For little mold problems, cut out the material, bag it, and throw it away right away. For serious mold issues, get out of the area, shut down any air flow (to prevent spore contamination) and call an expert. And remember that mold can appear in hidden locations like within walls or under floorings, so this assessment and water damage repair will be continuous.</p>
