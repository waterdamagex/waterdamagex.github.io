<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling because of a leaking roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can trigger you stress and anxiety and irritation, particularly if you have actually never done it in the past. Mold needs just three things to grow and endure: humidity, darkness and wetness. The most common locations in your home for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts. The very best way to avoid mold growth is to remove water leaks or moisture in your home. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Development?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
