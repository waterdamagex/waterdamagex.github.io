<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise produces extreme fumes and it even produces harmful gas when mixed with ammonia.
