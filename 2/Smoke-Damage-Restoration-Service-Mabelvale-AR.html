<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach likewise provides off extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these factors attempt to avoid using bleach and if you must use it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
<h3>Water Damage And Mold in Mabelvale Arkansas</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, nevertheless, using bleach is only efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not penetrate into porous products and so it does not enter contact with mold growing beneath the surface of materials such as wood and drywall. Utilizing bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface area however the roots within the material will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the afflicted location so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly during this process in order to ensure the solution remains well mixed.) Allow the liquid to sit on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the antibacterial residential or commercial properties have time to overcome the grime. Never scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores could spread out into air and trigger negative health effects.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a great alternative to chlorine bleach because it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave behind poisonous residue or produce poisonous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
