<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
