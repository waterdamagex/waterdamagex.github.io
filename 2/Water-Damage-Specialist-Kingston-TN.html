<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or business is one of the most devastating things that can take place to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being completely changed. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The sort of wood floor covering you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that require to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a broader range of choices to repair the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for private slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
