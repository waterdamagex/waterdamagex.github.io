<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
