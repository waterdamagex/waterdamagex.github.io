<h2>Are You Covered For Flood Damage in Wellington?</h2>

<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
