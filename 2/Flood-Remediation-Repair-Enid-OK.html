<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and slow deterioration of products (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical energy, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts typically begin corroding immediately after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the rust process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
