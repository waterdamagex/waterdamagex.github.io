<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
