<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Roxbury</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
