<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is moist and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
