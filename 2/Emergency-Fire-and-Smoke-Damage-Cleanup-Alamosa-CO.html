<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold safely and effectively. When you have water damage and aren't sure instantly from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipelines can be a major headache. Sprinkler line pipeline burst typically goes undetected up until the water comes hurrying through basement window wells and walls causing considerable basement water damage. A pipeline burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water raining down on the spaces inside your home.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a big brush, and bear in mind that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be removed and replaced. If basement carpet has become moldy, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to get rid of moisture if it's attached to the floor.</p>
