<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken.

Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Rapid air motion throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface moisture paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials need different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
