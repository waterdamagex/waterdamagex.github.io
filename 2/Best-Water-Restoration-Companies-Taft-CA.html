<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely harmful. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
