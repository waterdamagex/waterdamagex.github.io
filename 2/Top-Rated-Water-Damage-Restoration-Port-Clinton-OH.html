<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and steady deterioration of products (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electricity, oxygen, water and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components normally start rusting immediately after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of a problem. How quick the rust process takes depends on a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
