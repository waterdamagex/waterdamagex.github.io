<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach likewise provides off severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas. There are more secure options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce dangerous fumes or leave harmful residue. For these factors try to avoid using bleach and if you should use it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
