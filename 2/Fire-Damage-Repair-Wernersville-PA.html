Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
