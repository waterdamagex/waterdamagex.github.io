<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
