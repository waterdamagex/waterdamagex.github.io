Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
