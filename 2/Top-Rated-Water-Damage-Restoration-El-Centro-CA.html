<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
