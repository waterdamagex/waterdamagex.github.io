<p>Protect Non-Damaged Areas- Once containment barriers are established we will start eliminating the wet dry wall and start to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furniture out of the wet areas to guarantee that all excess wetness inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold problems occur later.<p>
<p>Storm and flood damage can be ravaging, and you need the company with storm damage experience. And lastly, monitor your health for possible symptoms. Mold may trigger asthma attacks (if you have asthma and dislike mold), running noses, sneezing, watery or itchy eyes, trouble breathing, skin irritation and more. A fire more than likely damages the roofing systems, windows, and walls. This can compromise the security of the property. The restoration team will offer board-up and roof-trap services to the property to secure it from trespassers.<p>
