<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
