<p>When a customer calls with a water damage emergency, our team is prepared to respond immediately.

When wet inbound air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process takes in wetness without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can quickly run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>
