<p>Numerous extremely contagious illnesses are connected to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's disease, along with blood, kidney, and liver problems. A few of the mold on the surface area may be killed but the roots of the mold are left intact meaning the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated bleaching. Perhaps this is why some individuals believe that spraying bleach on mold does not affect it but rather simply whitens its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
<p>A bleach solution also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface area and do not wash. As family appliances age, their pipelines may start to break and rust and their hoses or connections can damage as the products age. Fridges, water heaters, cleaning dishwaters and machines are all have many parts that are vulnerable to wear and tear, so keep a careful watch on older designs. The 2 biggest perpetrators for water damage in houses are cleaning makers and warm water tanks.<p>
