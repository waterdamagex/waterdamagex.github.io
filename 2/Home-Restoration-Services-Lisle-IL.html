<p>To remove soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floorings, utilize a mild soap or cleaning agent or mix together 4 to 6 tbsp. tri-sodium phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach to every gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves. Make certain to rinse surfaces with clear warm water and dry thoroughly.
