<p>Lastly, we want to attend to making use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Professional Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at getting rid of mold than a damp cloth and a mild cleaning agent, so we recommend the least poisonous choice.</p>
