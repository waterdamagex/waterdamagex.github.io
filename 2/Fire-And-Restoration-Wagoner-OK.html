Wear long sleeves and trousers to secure your skin. You must also use gloves and eye security. Given that you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is essential to set floor security and eliminate any furniture or family items that are not damaged. You can most likely get away with simply covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is small.

Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you don't track soot discolorations into other spaces.<p>
