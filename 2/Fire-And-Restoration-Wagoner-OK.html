Wear long sleeves and trousers to secure your skin. You must also use gloves and eye security. Given that you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is essential to set floor security and eliminate any furniture or family items that are not damaged. You can most likely get away with simply covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is small. But if you're cleaning a whole room, it's a good idea to get rid of those clean items and even seal other spaces that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you don't track soot discolorations into other spaces.<p>
