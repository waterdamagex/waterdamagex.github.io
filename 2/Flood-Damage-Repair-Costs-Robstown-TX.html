When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach also offers off harsh fumes and it even produces hazardous gas.

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This phase is essential, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to raise stains from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas underneath. Or simply get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface.</p>
