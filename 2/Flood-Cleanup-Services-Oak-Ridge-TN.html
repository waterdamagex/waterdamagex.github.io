<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Oak Ridge</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
