<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
