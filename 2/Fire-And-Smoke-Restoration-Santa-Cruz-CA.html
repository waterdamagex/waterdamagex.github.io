<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
