<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope problems, and building defects are an extremely serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing countless concerns due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, apartments, condos, townhouses, hotels, commercial structures are particularly susceptible to these issues as normally the contractor farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, therefore resulting in corners and costs being cut.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is often referred to as black mold or harmful mold due to the fact that of the mycotoxins that it can give off. This mold can be hazardous to your health in the type of chronic sinus infections, asthma, and tiredness. It grows in areas that stay constantly damp, like cooling systems. In addition to being hazardous, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it harder to successfully eliminate. Frequently, surfaces with black mold might need extra lightening or replacement to handle the stains. In many cases, an encapsulating agent might be needed to cover the stain and any remaining spores.</p>

<p>The time it takes for the mold removal process depends upon many aspects such as how much mold exists, where the mold is growing (behind walls, etc.), and the materials it grows on. Most mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpeting and drywall will naturally dry. Even more, actual time drying helps to immediately change fan speed, thaw cycles, and more to help accelerate drying times in varying conditions and structures.<p>
