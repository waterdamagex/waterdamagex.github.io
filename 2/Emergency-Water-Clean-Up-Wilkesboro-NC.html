<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be dangerous to your health, generally causing respiratory concerns. However in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you might want to buy a mold screening set to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and call in a professional to help with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home solutions (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help eliminate mold.</p>

Water invasion that includes a substantial amount of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may require unique techniques, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
