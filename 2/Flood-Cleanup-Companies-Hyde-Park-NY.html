<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being polluted with molds.
