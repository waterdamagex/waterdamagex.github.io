<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
