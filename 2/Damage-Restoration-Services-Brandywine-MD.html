<p>Drywall is really a panel of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between 2 kinds of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was very first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out an item called Sheetrock" indicated to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering.
