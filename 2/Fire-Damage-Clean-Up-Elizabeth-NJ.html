<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
