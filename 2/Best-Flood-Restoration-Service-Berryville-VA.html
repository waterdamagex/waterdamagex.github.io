<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
