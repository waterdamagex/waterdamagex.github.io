<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
