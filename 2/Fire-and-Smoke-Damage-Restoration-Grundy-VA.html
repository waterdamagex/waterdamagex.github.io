<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
