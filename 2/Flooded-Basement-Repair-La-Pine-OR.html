<p>The primary step in solving an indoor mold issue is to remove the wetness source; 18 new mold will start to grow on moist, permeable surfaces within 24 to 2 days. There are a variety of ways to prevent mold development. Some cleaning companies concentrate on fabric restoration, removing mold (and mold spores) from clothing to eliminate odor and avoid more damage to garments. Understanding the possible reasons for water damage helps you make the right decision about what remediation product and services are needed.<p>
<p>PureDry is a mold removal company with IICRC accredited service technicians prepared to remediate and restore industrial mold damaged Seattle properties back to their pre-loss condition. We understand the trauma of dealing with property and personal property or contents damage and make it our objective to return our clients' lives to normal as rapidly as possible. This may technically be true, but these materials will take a long period of time to dry by themselves. Even then, they will just dry on the surface. Concealed wetness behind walls and beneath carpeting can set off mold growth which will add to the damage and present health dangers brought on by mold exposure.<p>
