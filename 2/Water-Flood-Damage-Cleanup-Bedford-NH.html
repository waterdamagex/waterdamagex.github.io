Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged professional on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was designated to validate and test the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors.

<p>Once you've found the offending development, work up a mold-fighting option.

<p>Deodorization: In regards to deodorization, we use either ozone machines, which can only be used when the property is totally vacant for a prolonged time, or hydroxyl units.
