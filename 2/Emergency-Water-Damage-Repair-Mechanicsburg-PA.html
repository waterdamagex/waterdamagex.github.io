The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

Carpeting soaked by infected floodwater needs to be removed and discarded unless it can be sanitized at a commercial facility for an expense significantly less than replacement.
