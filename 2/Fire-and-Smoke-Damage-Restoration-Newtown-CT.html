Considering that a carpet cleaner can only do so much, you need a water damage cleanup team that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) absorb moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable plans of desiccants and damp items in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants alter color to show they are saturated, which can take days or weeks, depending on just how much moisture products include.<p>
