<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning.
