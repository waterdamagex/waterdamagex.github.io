<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Belgrade</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is ended up.<p>
