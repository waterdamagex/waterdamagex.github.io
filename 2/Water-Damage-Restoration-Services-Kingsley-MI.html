<h3>Fire And Smoke Restoration in Kingsley</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
