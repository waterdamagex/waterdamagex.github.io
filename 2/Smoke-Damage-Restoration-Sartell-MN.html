<p>It is simple for a property owner to think the damage to their home or service is restricted to the visually verified damage. At FP Property Restoration, we understand that this is not the case. Surrounding areas, contents, ventilation systems, and surfaces are all affected by smoke, water from the extinguishment of the fire, and the recurring odor that, if not dealt with properly, will never leave your home.<p>
<p>Any sources of water, moisture, or humidity need to be attended to and completely dried prior to mold remediation can begin due to the fact that mold thrives in moisture.
