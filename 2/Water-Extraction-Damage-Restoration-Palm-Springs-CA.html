<p>Smoke damage is a typical adverse effects of fire damage, however it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. Without proper cleaning, smoke smell remains in clothing, linens, drapes, pillows, clothes and other soft" items for months or longer.

Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
