<h2>Flood Damage Insurance Claims in Melville</h2>

<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
