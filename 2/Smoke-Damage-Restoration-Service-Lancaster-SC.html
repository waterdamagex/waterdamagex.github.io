<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electrical energy, oxygen, metal and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal parts generally start wearing away immediately after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How fast the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
