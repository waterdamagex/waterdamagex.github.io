<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
<h3>Flooded Basement in Plaquemine Louisiana</h2>
<p>The absolute last thing any house owner wishes to see is water where it isn't expected to be. Water damage is among the most feared home problems, and for excellent reason. Water damage spreads quick and can cause mold and other airborne irritants. And while you may be believing, Water absorbs. I can save a couple of dollars and handle water damage on my own, right?" You would be sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health threat, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
