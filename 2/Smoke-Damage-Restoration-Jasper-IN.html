<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges.
