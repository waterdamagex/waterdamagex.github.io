<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of products (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally start wearing away instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of a problem. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
