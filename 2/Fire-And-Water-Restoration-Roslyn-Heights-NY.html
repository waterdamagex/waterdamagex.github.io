<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying given that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>
