<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in La Salle</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health hazard and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
