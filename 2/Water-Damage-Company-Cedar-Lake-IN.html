<p>You want to resolve restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Use a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it might mistakenly press liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to draw more water out if the phone was totally immersed. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is vital to avoid recontamination. You need to seal and immediately deal with products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you used while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
