<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a moist towel. As with some of the above approaches, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
