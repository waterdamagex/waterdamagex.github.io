<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
