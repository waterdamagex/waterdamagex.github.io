<p>Basements are extremely common locations for mold to take hold and grow. They tend to get damp, that makes the best conditions for growing mold in corners and on walls and floors. While the typical basement is around 1,000, it's uncommon for mold to fill the entire area, with most basement mold areas being available in around 100-200 This has a cleanup and remediation cost of around $1,500-$ 3,000 usually.
