<p>Flooding often impacts several residential or commercial properties, and ensuring your property is tidied up and brought back as soon as possible needs you to get the phone and call now!

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every two to three rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
