<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold securely and successfully. Classification 3 - Category 3 water is grossly infected and can include pathogenic, toxigenic, or other damaging agents. Examples of Classification 3 water can consist of, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that stem from beyond the toilet trap no matter visible content or color; all forms of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water entering or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, hurricanes, or other weather condition related events.
