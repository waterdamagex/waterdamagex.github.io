<p>Fire is the result of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furniture - has actually been warmed to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger enduring damage and must be dealt with by experienced specialists, heat is the most visible, and harmful, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
