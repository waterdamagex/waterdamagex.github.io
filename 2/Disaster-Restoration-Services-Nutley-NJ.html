<p>Food sources for mold in structures consist of cellulose-based materials such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and organic matter such as soap, fabrics, and dust consisting of skin cells.

Noticeable mold nests might form where ventilation is poorest and on border walls (since they are nearest the humidity ).</p>

First, get rid of moisture by setting up a dehumidifier and making sure the clothes dryer vent exhausts externally, if you utilize your basement for laundry.
