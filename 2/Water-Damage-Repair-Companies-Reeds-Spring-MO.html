<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

A water disaster can be aggravating and difficult-- and a trustworthy, thoughtful restoration group can help ease your worries and make the process of getting life back to normal, pain-free and worry-free.
