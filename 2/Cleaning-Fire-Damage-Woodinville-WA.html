Examples of Category 3 water can include, however are not restricted to: sewage; toilet backflows that stem from beyond the toilet trap despite noticeable material or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from streams or rivers; and other polluted water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from hurricanes, hurricanes, or other weather related occasions. Such water sources might bring silt, raw material, pesticides, heavy metals, controlled products, or harmful natural substances.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
