<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
