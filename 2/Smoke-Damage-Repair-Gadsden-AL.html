<p>Learn how to remove black mold safely and successfully. When you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or damaged pipes can be a significant headache. Sprinkler line pipeline burst typically goes unnoticed until the water comes rushing through basement window wells and walls triggering substantial basement water damage. A pipe burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water drizzling down on the rooms inside your home.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any difficult surfaces to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be removed, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are removed, normally involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
