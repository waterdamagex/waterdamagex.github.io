Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized professional on the biological aspects of air pollution, this team was assigned to verify and evaluate the new technology.

Together, we were able to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial clients that, unlike any other method or device, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
