<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a household or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
