We focus on cleaning and repairing residential or commercial properties that have actually suffered fire damage and work toward securing and protecting your property from more damage. Shop vacuums or the companies that only have carpet drying devices can't avoid the water from harming the walls, under molding or baseboards.

They usually have generators so that the devices can be utilized correctly to repair the damage.
