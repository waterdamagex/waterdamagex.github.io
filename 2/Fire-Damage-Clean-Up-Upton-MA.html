Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and just starts to sag before drying, repairing it may just need pressing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
