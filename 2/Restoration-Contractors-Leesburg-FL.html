<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
