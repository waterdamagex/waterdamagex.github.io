<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely harmful. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (often twice a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and likewise were really useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.

<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas.

For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you should use it, just use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
