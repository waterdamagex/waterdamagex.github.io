This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
