<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This might exacerbate the issue because as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>
