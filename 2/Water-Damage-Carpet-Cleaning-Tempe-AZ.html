These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
