Using bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation.

Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at eliminating mold than a moist cloth and a mild cleaning agent, so we advise the least poisonous alternative.</p>
