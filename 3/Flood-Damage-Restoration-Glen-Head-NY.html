<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
