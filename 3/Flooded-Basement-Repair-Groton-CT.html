<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
