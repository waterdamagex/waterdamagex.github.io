<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly.
