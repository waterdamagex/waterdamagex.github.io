<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
