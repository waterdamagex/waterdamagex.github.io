<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or service can experience. Soot is the effect of wood and other fuels not being entirely taken in by flames. Throughout a fire, soot increases as fine particles of carbon and trace chemical substances.

Santa Rosa and Mountain View ares together with Santa Rosa and Oakland are all well within the Essential Restoration extended fire damage restoration service area.

<p>Mold in your home or service can end up being a big issue. A minor leakage that goes unnoticed or the presence of high humidity can trigger mold to form.

<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous person.</p>
