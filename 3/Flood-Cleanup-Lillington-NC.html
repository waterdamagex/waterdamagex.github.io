<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance coverage to have in any situation, especially when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater looms unless fixed rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a large brush, and bear in mind that permeable surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be gotten rid of and replaced.
