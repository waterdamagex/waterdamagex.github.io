<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is good and damp, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
