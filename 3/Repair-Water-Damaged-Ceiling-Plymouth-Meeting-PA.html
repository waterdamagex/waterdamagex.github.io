<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be.
