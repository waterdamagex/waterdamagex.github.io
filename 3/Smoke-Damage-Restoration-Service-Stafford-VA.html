<p>Black mold can be harmful if it is Stachybotrys black mold. Many molds can achieve the color of black, but not all mold is the terrifying Stachybotrys black mold. So how do you understand?

<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Stafford</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This could worsen the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves damp environments.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can get rid of water vapor from the air in a contained location, like a bedroom or downstairs rec space. Shut the space's windows and doors to prevent more humidity from seeping in. Purchase a big dehumidifier ($ 270) so you don't need to clear its water drawer often. First things initially. Get the iPhone out of the water immediately, if you haven't already. And don't even think of plugging it in.<p>
