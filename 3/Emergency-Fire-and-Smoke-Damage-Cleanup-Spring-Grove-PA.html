<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
