<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Atascosa</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
