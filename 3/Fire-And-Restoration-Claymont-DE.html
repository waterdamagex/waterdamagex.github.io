<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Claymont</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
