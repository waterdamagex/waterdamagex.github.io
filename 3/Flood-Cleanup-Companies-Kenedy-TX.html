<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Kenedy</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
