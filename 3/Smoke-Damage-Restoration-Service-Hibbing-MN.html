<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
