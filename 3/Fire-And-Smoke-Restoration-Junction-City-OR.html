<p>Mold can be discovered almost anywhere you turn. They grow on essentially any organic substance as long as moisture and oxygen are present.

<p>Mold is virtually everywhere, drifting in the air and on all surface areas. People are exposed to molds 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

Raised exposure can also occur if people straight handle musty materials or inadvertently consume mold.</p>

<p>To buy time, place damp books and images into plastic bags and location in a frost-free freezer. This will stop additional degeneration, and avoid mold and mildew. When you have time, retrieve books from the freezer and air- or fan-dry the pages. Mold can grow just about anywhere, but it generally prospers in warm, wet or humid environments It can likewise sometimes be discovered in drier environments that have poor ventilation or air flow.<p>
<p>Note: While a lot of experts recommend a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and dust mites.
