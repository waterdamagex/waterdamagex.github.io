Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
