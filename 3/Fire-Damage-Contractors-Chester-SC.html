<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>A solution of detergent and warm water can be utilized to scrub surface mold off non-porous surface areas. Although detergent itself does not eliminate mold, if the mold is on non-porous materials then the service does not need to kill it as long as you completely clean away all the mold on the surface area. Using a pump sprayer, mist the surfaces with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the sections. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
<p>Any mold you kill by scrubbing is just going to come back if there is a water problem. Fix these problems initially. Clean the area and see how quickly the mold comes back if you suspect a leak. You may need to hire someone to repair the problem if it pops up rapidly. Water damage resulting from permeating water is progressive, pervasive and it can cause irreversible damage to your important items. This is particularly a possibility if the emergency reaction does not show up within very first two days. It's essential to call quickly and get the water mitigation procedure started to prevent additional damage if you have a flooded basement or ceiling water damage.<p>
