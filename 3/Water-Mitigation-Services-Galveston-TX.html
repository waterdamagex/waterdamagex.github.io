<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the space you're fixing so that you know just how much brand-new wallboard you require. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and after that secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets. Then apply joint substance over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the compound dry for the time specified by the maker and then sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper up until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
