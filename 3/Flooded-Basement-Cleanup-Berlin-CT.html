<p>In more advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leak or radiant floor heating leak), repairing the subfloor might even be needed. For best results, refinish the entire room, as trying to repair a small area will show up for several years, offering an apparent sign that the floor has actually had some kind of damage. You can tell if your screen has actually been damaged by water if there are lines or dark spots under the glass. It is hard to say whether this damage is going to be long-term or if it will result in other problems, so the very best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
<p>Fixing pipes, sealing fixture casing, or modifying landscaping water circulation channels might be all you need to remedy the situation. Nevertheless, in many cases you will require an expert to recognize and repair the source of unwanted water circulation. If buckling or warping has taken place, drive nails where the floor tends to raise or bulge. This will avoid additional damage. Severely deformed hardwood floors normally can't be fixed. Distorted, broad pine board floor covering, however, will often flatten out after it has completely dried.<p>
