<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Lots of people swear by raw rice, recommending owners to put their damp iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the things (cover it completely) and leave it there for 48 hours or two. A: Mold is a tiny fungus that is part of the natural environment and required for our community. While it is required in the outside world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unhygienic and hazardous. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores drift through the air both inside and outside.<p>

Wrap a small piece of absorbent cloth around a toothpick or pin, utilize this to take in any water from the charging port, headphone jack, and sim card tray. Home insurance might cover water damage, however constantly contact your company before filing a claim. For instance, you might require flood insurance coverage if the damage happened due to a flood.<p>
