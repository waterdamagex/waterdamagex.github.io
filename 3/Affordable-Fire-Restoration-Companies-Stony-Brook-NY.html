<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are utilized on any difficult surface areas to get rid of the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are eliminated, usually including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
