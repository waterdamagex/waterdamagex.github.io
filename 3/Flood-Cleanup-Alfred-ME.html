Numerous homes with water damage lack fundamental weatherproofing products, assessment reports state. Coats of stucco are typically too thin. According to a lawsuit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, workmanship was so bad that, even before the household relocated, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bedroom.</p>
