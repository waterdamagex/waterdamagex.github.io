When MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components.

If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
