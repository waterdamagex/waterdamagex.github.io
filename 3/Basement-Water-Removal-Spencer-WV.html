<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>

<p>Class 3 - greatest quantity of absorption, evaporation, and water. Water invasion where damp, permeable products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where products referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in very little moisture.</p>
<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier gets rid of water vapor from the air using a procedure called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to get rid of a substantial amount of water vapor below 40 grains per pound. Due to the fact that they are much more energy efficient and they can pull the grains down much lower, lgrs are a distinct form of commercial and residential grade refrigerant dehumidifiers. LGR dehumidifiers utilize a double cooling or enhanced step to lower the moisture-laden air temperature when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
<p>Class 1 - least amount of absorption, water, and evaporation load. Water invasion where wet, porous materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent less than ~ 5% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have absorbed very little moisture.</p>
