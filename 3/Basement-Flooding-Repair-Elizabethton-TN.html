<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
