<p>After the water and moisture have actually been removed the next action to repair water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted locations.

<p>Open doors and windows to eliminate moisture and smells if the weather allows. If the outside humidity ends up being higher than within, close things up; similarly, close up your house overnight if temperatures drop and damp air might otherwise be drawn inside. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and remove whole sash. If doors are stuck, eliminate door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then eliminate.</p>
<p>Additional Services Offered: Many contractors see the need to add or offer additional services. After some time in business, you're losing out on extra dollars to subcontractors. Including all-purpose or crossover items for supplemental work makes decision-making for consumers that much easier. Including services such as commercial or residential clean-up, painting, sanding, or home improvement will further increase your revenues, experience, and referrals.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely courteous and easy-going person.</p>
