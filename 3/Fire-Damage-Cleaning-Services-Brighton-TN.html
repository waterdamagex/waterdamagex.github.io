Warm air between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is perfect, especially for the first 36 to two days of drying and is the optimum temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Overly hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit impedes the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surface areas, enable the bleach option to continue to penetrate the surfaces and dry.
