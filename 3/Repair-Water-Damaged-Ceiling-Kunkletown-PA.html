Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
