<p>As a full service fire damage company, we understand how structures and contents respond to smoke, fire, and heat, and what actions are required to minimize the damage for property owners. We specialize in cleaning and repairing homes that have actually suffered fire damage and work toward safeguarding and securing your property from further damage. Shop vacuums or the companies that just have carpet drying devices can't avoid the water from harming the walls, under molding or baseboards.

<p>In more advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leakage or radiant floor heating leak), repairing the subfloor might even be required. For best outcomes, refinish the whole room, as attempting to repair a little area will be visible for many years, offering an apparent sign that the floor has actually had some kind of damage. You can tell if your screen has been damaged by water if there are lines or dark spots under the glass. It is hard to state whether this damage is going to be permanent or if it will result in other problems, so the best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
