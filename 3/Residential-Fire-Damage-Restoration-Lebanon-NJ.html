It can be a long-term health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

Printable versions of these and other assistance files are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be essential.<p>
