It can be a long-term health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
