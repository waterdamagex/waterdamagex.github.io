<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can often allow rain throughout the cooler months which can seep through the walls. With time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to peel, bubble and flake. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into an unloved and worn out  space.<p>
<p>Don't presume your house owners insurance coverage will pay to repair your mold issues. Insurance usually pays if the issue arises from an emergency currently covered on your policy, like a burst pipeline, but not if mold arised from deferred maintenance, relentless moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance). If you experience water damage, it's important NOT to take a knee jerk response. It's best to call your insurance provider immediately. Choosing the restoration company is completely chosen by the home owner.<p>
