Essentially, it makes the location strong again and protects the surface from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>

<p>Remove your case if you have one on, or anything that might be trapping water in the phone. If flood damage isn't managed immediately, the damage (and flood restoration expenses) increase.

<p>After scrubbing the surface areas, enable the bleach service to continue to penetrate the surfaces and dry.
