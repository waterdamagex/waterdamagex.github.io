<p>Before you clean your home, you need to use correct security. Smoke, soot and particles can be unsafe to inhale, so use a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged area. Use long sleeves and trousers to secure your skin. You need to also use gloves and eye security. Considering that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it's important to put down floor security and eliminate any furniture or household objects that are not damaged. If the damaged area is small, you can probably get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets. However if you're cleaning a whole room, it's a good idea to remove those clean items and even seal off other spaces that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you don't track soot discolorations into other spaces.<p>
