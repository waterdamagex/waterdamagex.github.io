<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can offer your living-room a sense of warmth and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can frequently allow rain throughout the colder months which can leak through the walls. In time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and tired  area.<p>
<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: major leakage or radiant floor heating leakage), repairing the subfloor might even be necessary. For best results, refinish the entire space, as trying to repair a little area will be visible for several years, offering an apparent indication that the floor has had some form of damage. If your screen has actually been damaged by water if there are lines or dark areas under the glass, you can inform. It is challenging to say whether this damage is going to be permanent or if it will result in other issues, so the very best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller sized hole (approximately 6"), apply a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Put your patch into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the compound and enable it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a second layer of joint substance to end up the repair.
