<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
