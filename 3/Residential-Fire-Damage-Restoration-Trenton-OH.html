<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show noticeable signs of wetness, leaking water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you might discover small signs like coffee-colored stains that might broaden over time.</p>
<p>The most important element of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew.
