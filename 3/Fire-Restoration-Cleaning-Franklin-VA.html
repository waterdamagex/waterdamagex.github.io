<p>Since it's difficult to eliminate mold in your home completely, it is essential to keep your air clear by routinely changing air filters.

<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>
