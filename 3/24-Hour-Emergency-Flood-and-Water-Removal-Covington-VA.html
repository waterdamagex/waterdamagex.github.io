<h3>Flood Damage Cleanup in Covington Virginia</h2>
<p>A/C: Heater and air conditioner units can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights. They can also become muddy, and cleaning them will need professional cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and end up being contaminated. If that occurs, they must be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to prevent contamination from being blown through the air.</p>
<p>Jake (and his team) are remarkable to work with. They were quick to react at first and provided a reasonable and fair quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done extremely quickly. Our mold issue ended up being smaller than first thought so the final billing reflected the actual work required and was less than very first quoted. Jake was really responsive to calls and emails addressing concerns throughout the process. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Recent Review: A pipe burst in my crawlspace, triggering significant water accumulation. Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain pipes the location prior to any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and set up brand-new insulation in the area. They offered excellent, efficient, and expert service as well as being friendly and enjoyable to deal with. I wholeheartedly suggest Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again need to the need arise.</p>
