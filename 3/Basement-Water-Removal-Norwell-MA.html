<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually impacted your valuables, we will work with you and your insurance company to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be brought back, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged belongings. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from seeping back through. Basically, it makes the location solid once again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
