<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic items such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires wetness, although some mold types can obtain that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent.

The permeable material can rapidly take in flood water, and you need to understand the extent of potential damage.<p>
