<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

First, remove wetness by setting up a dehumidifier and making sure the clothes dryer vent exhausts externally, if you use your basement for laundry.
