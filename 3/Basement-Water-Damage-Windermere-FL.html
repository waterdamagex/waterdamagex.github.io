<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
