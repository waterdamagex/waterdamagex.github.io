<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
