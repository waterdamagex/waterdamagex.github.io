<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a household or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process.
