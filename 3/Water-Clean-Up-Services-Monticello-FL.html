These conditions can assist in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
