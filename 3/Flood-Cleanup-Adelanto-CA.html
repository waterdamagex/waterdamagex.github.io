<p>Notification that your house is flooded? Do not lose time, and call a professional immediately. A flooded home is not something that you can repair yourself if you have no experience with the circumstance. Call a water damage restoration company that can totally evaluate the degree of the damage, and can use the very best strategy. Don't even consider taking a hair dryer to your handset. Added heat could cause deterioration if there is any water on your phone's hardware. Rather, start with a soft, microfiber cloth, the kind you use to clean smudges off of your glasses. Utilize a fabric to clean down the elements inside if you can get rid of the back panel of your phone.<p>
