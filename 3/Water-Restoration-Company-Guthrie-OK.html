Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
