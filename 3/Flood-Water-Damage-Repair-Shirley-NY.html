<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish wear and tear of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal parts usually begin wearing away right away after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of an issue. How quickly the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
