<h3>Why You Should Hire Ellenboro Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
