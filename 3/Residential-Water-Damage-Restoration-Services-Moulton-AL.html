The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach stability. Calculating the humidity is important in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid type if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point increases, the greater the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>
