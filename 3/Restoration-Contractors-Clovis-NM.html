<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Not to make complex the matter, but to include some clarity to the problem of mold, mold spores threaten. They threaten whether dead or alive. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning. Oftentimes, mold spores can be eliminated rather easily from surface areas. But a stain can remain. An all-encompassing mold remediation and stain removal must be carried out to guarantee a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
