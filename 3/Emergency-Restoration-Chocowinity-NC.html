<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>As the job advances and the environment is supported, products can be dried by managing the humidity, energy, and air flow (heat).

The overall need for humidity control and air flow can be lower than at the start of the project given that there is significantly less moisture in products being vaporized throughout the latter stage.</p>
<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach stability. Determining the humidity is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
