<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become infected with molds.
