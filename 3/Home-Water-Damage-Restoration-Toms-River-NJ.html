<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be.
