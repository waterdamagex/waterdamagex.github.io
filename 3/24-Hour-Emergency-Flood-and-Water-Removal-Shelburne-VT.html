<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes.</p>
