Kitchen area flare-ups, closed fireplace flues, and electrical fires can send out smoke throughout your home, charring walls, covering everything, and stinking up the place.

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This stage is necessary, as these sponges use special chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Begin wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas beneath. Or merely get a brand-new sponge. Ensure you use a cleaning movement the whole time.
