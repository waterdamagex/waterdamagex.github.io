<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Because it is a health threat, many people are distressed to remove mold after they identify it. But health concerns are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to motivations for getting rid of mold.

Resident may not even understand that their home is at danger when they spot mold, however it is really dangerous for the stability of the structure. As it grows, mold can deteriorate surfaces inside a structure like its floors and walls, or perhaps the structure.</p>
