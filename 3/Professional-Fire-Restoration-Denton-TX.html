<p>Prior to you clean your home, you must wear proper protection. Soot, particles and smoke can be hazardous to inhale, so use a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged area. Use long sleeves and pants to protect your skin. You must also wear gloves and eye security. Given that you will be releasing soot as you clean, it's important to set floor defense and remove any furniture or family objects that are not damaged. If the damaged area is small, you can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets. However if you're cleaning an entire room, it's a good idea to get rid of those clean items and even seal off other spaces that are undamaged. Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you do not track soot spots into other rooms.<p>
<p>The biggest component that can be eliminated is the wetness that mold needs to cultivate.
