Nevertheless, if water or wetness is left untreated inside your home and mold begins to colonize, it can pose a major health risk. Mold remediation can rapidly and safely remove a mold problem from your office or home. Depending upon the size of your problem, mold remediation might take anywhere from one to seven days (or more) to eliminate the major sources of mold in your house.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when moist incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This process absorbs wetness without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
