<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
