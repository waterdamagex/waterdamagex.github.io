While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
