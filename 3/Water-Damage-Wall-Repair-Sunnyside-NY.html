<p>Learn how to remove black mold securely and effectively. When you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or damaged pipelines can be a significant headache.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
