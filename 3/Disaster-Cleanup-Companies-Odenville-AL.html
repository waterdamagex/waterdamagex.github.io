To eliminate mold: Add one quarter of a tablespoon of baking soda to a spray bottle of water and shake until it has actually liquified. Spray the moldy area with the sodium bicarbonate and water option, then use a scrub brush to remove all the mold from the surface area. Next, rinse the surface area with water to eliminate any recurring mold on the surface area.<p>
<p>Many highly contagious diseases are linked to water damage consisting of skin infections, liver disease A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's disease, in addition to blood, liver, and kidney concerns. Some of the mold on the surface area may be killed but the roots of the mold are left intact meaning the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated whitening. Maybe this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold doesn't impact it but rather simply bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
