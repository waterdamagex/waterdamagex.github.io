Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite individual.</p>
