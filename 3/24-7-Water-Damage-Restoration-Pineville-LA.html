<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning. When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to complete.<p>
