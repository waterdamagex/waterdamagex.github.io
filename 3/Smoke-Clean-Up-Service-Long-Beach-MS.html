<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the service on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily.
