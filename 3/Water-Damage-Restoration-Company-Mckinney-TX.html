<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the sluggish and progressive wear and tear of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electrical energy, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically start corroding right away after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the rust process takes depends on a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
