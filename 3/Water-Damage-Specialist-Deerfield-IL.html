<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and generally have poor ventilation and little air flow, a combination that can cause mold to flourish. And obviously, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to severe weather condition or unnoticed leaks in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, when mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating option, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle consistently during this process in order to make sure the service stays well mixed.) Allow the liquid to sit on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the antibacterial residential or commercial properties have time to resolve the grime. Never scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores could spread into air and cause negative health results.</p>
