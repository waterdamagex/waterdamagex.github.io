<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every single two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>

<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
