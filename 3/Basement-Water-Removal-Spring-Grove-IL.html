<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Spring Grove</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
