<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be far more damp than above-ground levels and usually have poor ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can trigger mold to grow. And of course, basements can be prone to flooding, due to extreme weather condition or unnoticed leaks in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, concrete block or concrete walls can be hard to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Material Removal: Some materials will have to be gotten rid of prior to the start of the cleaning process. Typically, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond saving.

<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and progressive degeneration of materials (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts generally begin wearing away instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of a problem.

The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
