<p>Any structure that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore defense, and cover hands, arms and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning.
