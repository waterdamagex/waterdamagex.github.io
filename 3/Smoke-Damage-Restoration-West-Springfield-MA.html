Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be.
