<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
