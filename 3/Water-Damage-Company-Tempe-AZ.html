Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve.
