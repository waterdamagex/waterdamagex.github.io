Our heatpump low-grain dehumidifiers are used to get rid of moisture - a silent, yet resilient factor to persistent structural and content damage. How accessible a water damaged space is and the products involved also play important functions in figuring out the cost of water mitigation and the subsequent restoration process.<p>
