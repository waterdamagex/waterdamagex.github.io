<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Elizabeth</h2>

Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

Drying might need unique techniques, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
