<p>You want to deal with bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Our local Doral area SERVPRO has the training and proficiency to offer services for your industrial or residential home damage restoration, repair or cleanup requirements. Our SERVPRO experts can restore and repair your property following a water fire, smoke and damage damage, mold damage, or flood and storm damage event. When your surface is solid and dry, use a filler to make the surface area smooth and all set for painting. Normally, you must offer this action a minimum of a complete day of drying time. We sort of cheated in the video above by using a hair clothes dryer to speed up the procedure, however finest practice here is one-day drying time.<p>
