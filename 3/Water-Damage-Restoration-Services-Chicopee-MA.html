It may be covered by insurance coverage when a product currently covered under your house owners insurance coverage breaks accidentally-- for example, if your pipes unexpectedly ruptures and water floods your home, the property owners insurance will cover part or all of the expenses for the plumbing repair and any mold remediation costs required as a direct outcome of the water damage.<p>
