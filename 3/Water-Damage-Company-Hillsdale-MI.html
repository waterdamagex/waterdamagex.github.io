Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve.
