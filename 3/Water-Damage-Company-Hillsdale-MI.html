<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful individual.</p>
