<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise sometimes described as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on wet materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth must be avoided. Mold replicate by methods of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, but undetectable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas.
