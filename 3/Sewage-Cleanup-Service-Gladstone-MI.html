<p>The most important element of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew take place most often when wet drywall sits with inadequate ventilation. No matter the location or degree of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic family fans are not capable of moving an adequate quantity of air required to dry a space properly.</p>
