<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
