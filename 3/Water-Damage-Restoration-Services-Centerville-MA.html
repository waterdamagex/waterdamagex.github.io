<p>Find out how to remove black mold securely and successfully. Make sure to wear adequate protective gear if you select to manage the mold removal yourself. The CDC suggests that you wear long trousers and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and glasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated a minimum of N-95 or more to secure your nose and mouth.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
