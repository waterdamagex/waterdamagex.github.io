<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
