<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
