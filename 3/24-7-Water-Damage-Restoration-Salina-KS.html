<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done correctly.
