Desiccant dehumidifiers - This sort of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction rather of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a material that holds and draws in moisture.

Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
