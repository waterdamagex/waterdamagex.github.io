<p>Flooring water damage. Another indication to search for is the warping of flooring materials due to water exposure. Floor covering water damage can really go undetected for some time if the spot is located in the corners of a space or against a wall. If you observe any warping of wood or vinyl 6 floor covering, then the location is likely exposed. Furthermore, wet areas of carpet suggest water damage.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications.</p>
