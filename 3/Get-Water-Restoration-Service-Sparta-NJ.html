<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Throughout a water loss emergency, nearly every area of your Seattle home might be at threat for damage.

This mold can be harmful to your health in the form of persistent sinus infections, asthma, and fatigue. It grows in locations that remain continuously wet, like a/c systems. In addition to being damaging, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it more difficult to successfully remove.

The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
