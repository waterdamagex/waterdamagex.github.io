<p>Mold can be discovered almost anywhere you turn. They grow on essentially any organic compound as long as wetness and oxygen exist. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation.

<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Calculating the dew point is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point increases, the greater the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>
