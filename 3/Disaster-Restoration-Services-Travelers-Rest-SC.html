<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
