<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
