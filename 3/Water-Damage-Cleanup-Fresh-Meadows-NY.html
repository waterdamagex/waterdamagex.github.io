<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can offer your living-room a sense of warmth and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can often allow rain throughout the chillier months which can leak through the walls. With time, wetness from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and tired  space.<p>
<p>Do not presume your house owners insurance will pay to fix your mold problems.
