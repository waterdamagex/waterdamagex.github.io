First, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a damp fabric and a mild cleaning agent, so we recommend the least poisonous choice.</p>
<p>Often water streams unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall.
