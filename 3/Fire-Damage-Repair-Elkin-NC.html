<p>Even when you include a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's because fire is a noticeable combustion of light and heat, and many people know how to include a fire. For that reason, people will work to contain a fire without prioritizing smoke damage avoidance. Smoke is slightly more difficult to see than the fire itself and appears less threatening. Also, because it's in the air, it's nearly impossible to contain. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can cause damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often needed to restore damage left from little indoor fires.</p>

<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying.
