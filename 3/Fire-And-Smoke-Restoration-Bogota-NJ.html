<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator ranked for black mold spore security, and cover hands, arms and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize business black mold removal products, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding locations. If you utilize bleach, make sure it will not blemish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a nearby exit as opposed to the primary home, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
