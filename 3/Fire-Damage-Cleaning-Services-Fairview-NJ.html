<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice 3 to five lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to some of the above approaches, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
