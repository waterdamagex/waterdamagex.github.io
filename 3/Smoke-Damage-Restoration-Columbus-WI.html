<p>Vapor pressure is directly associated to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is used to a material, energy is included. Raising the temperature level of a damp material increases the rate of evaporation, more launching wetness from the product and altering the internal vapor pressure. The greater the distinction between ambient temperature and humidity temperature level, the greater the potential for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
