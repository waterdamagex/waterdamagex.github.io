<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Lakeport</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health hazard and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Temperature Control - Through this final step we use the principles of psychrometry, making sure that all wetness when eliminated is not put back into the structure, therefore minimizing the opportunity of mold and mildew development.
