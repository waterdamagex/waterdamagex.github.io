<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you actually want to prevent purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this solution and wipe it directly over mold growth. Let the option sit for up to 10 minutes, and then scrub the area with a little brush or toothbrush. Wipe any remaining mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>
