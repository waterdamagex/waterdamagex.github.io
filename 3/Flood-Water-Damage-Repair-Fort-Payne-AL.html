<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most destructive things that can occur to a family or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being totally changed. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing, if there is minor damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may need changing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The kind of wood floor covering you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen. Strong hardwood flooring enables a broader series of alternatives to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
