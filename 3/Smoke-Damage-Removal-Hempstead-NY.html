<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>Now the mold is removed. In the process of addressing mold growth, Mold Solutions NW uses a range of specialized products. One product we use is MMR, an industrial grade tool that gets deep beneath the external layer to ruin mold. Additionally, we deal with the discolorations often caused by a mold development.
