When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
