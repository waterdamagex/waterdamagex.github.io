The same thickness is used for ceilings, but 3/4 inch is not unusual where the design called for more rigidness. For arches and curves, 1/4 inch is utilized. While it can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, many home centers do equip smaller pieces and some will even cut pieces to size for you for a cost.<p>
<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Mold discovered in residential houses can lead to respiratory concerns, long-lasting illness, and even death. Though these conditions are rare, it is not a risk worth taking.

We offer instant mold remediation services for property owners throughout the nation. To replace the entire sheet, get rid of the damaged drywall entirely, to the studs. Eliminate the drywall screws that anchored the old sheet to the studs utilizing a power drill. If there was a lot of water damage, this need to be fairly simple; the old drywall will more than likely fall apart away.<p>
<p>While it is possible to clean lots of surfaces of mold yourself, there are some benefits to using expert remediation.
