Countless homeowners have discovered the problems just after it's too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the deadline by simply weeks or months.</p>

If they have been damaged, we will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>
