Even as home builders have actually combated claims, nearly two lots homeowners said that they were never ever alerted of any possible issue-- even as some building executives understood of its level. Toll's vice president of construction, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, affirmed in 2017 that, within slightly more than 2 years, he had checked 300 to 350 homes in the region for water intrusion-- with approximately 85 percent needing repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court. Countless homeowners have discovered the problems just after it's too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing out on the deadline by simply weeks or months.</p>

If they have been damaged, we will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>
