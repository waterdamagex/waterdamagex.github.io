<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold experts typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area.

There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might exacerbate the issue since as you understand - mold loves damp environments.<p>
