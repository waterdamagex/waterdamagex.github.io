<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold experts typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might exacerbate the issue since as you understand - mold loves damp environments.<p>
