<h3>Local Fire Damage Restoration in Waltham</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health threat and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
